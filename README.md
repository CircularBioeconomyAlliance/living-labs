# AWS Hackathon | Team Living Labs 🌱🧪

The Circular Bioeconomy Alliance (CBA) is participating in the AWS Breaking Barriers Challenge 2026 to tackle a fundamental barrier to ambitious landscape regeneration: fragmented, inconsistent data. Many projects implementing nature-based solutions (ranging from regenerative agriculture to ecological restoration) track outcomes inconsistently, making it difficult to ensure accountability, compare results, demonstrate impact to donors and investors, or understand which approaches work best in different contexts.
 
At the heart of CBA’s work are seven science-based Principles for Regenerative Landscapes, which define success across nature, climate, and people. Today, these principles are difficult to measure consistently, robustly, and cost-effectively across projects and geographies, limiting learning and scale.
 
During this hackathon, we aim to build a digital foundation for a unified Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) system that translates CBA’s 7 Principles into practical, measurable indicators. This system will use AI to guide project teams in identifying and tracking the indicators that best prove their impact. The CBA seeks to deploy this system across all our “Living Labs” which are projects on the ground, e.g., demonstration cases of how nature-based solutions deliver regenerative outcomes. By turning fragmented field data into a shared, cloud-based platform, we can strengthen accountability and create clear, evidence-based blueprints that show regenerative, nature-based economies are investable, scalable, and ready for global adoption.

## The challenge
Create solutions to help project teams, e.g. implementers, farmers, to:
1. Select indicators to measure progress towards the CBA Principles. Indicator selection should be based on local context (e.g. project description, objectives, and expected outcomes) as well as indicators' ease of use, accuracy, and costs.
2. Systematically collect data and transfer this data to an unified data lake (managed by CBA).
